# 🧠 Nexus — AI‑Agentic E‑Commerce Platform

Nexus is an AI‑powered e‑commerce platform where users interact with an intelligent shopping agent instead of traditional search bars and filters. The agent understands user intent, builds curated product bundles, manages carts, and coordinates inventory reservation and order placement.

The platform is designed to demonstrate **production‑grade backend engineering**, combining:

* Agentic AI (Spring AI + RAG)
* Secure microservices (Spring Security)
* Event‑driven architecture (Kafka)
* Metrics, logging, and distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
